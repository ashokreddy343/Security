What are they?And How to Disover & Exploit Basic File Upload Vulnerabilities
	Exploitation File Upload Vulns
		1.Simples type of vulnerabilities
		2.Allow users to upload executable files such as php
	Upload a php shell or backdoor,ex:weevly
		1.Generate backdoor >weevly generate [password][filename]
		2.Upload generated file 
		3.Connect to it	>weevly [url to file][password]
		4.Find out how to use weevly >help
		>weevely generate 123456 /root/shell.php
		>weevely http://10.20.14.204/dvwa/hackable/uploads/shell.php 123456
		weevely offers more features
HTTP Request - GET & POST
	Intercepting Requests-Basic Information flow
		1.User clicks on a link
		2.HTMl Website generates a request(client side)
		3.Request is sent to the server
		4.Server performs the request(server side)
		5.Sends response back
Intercepting HTTP Requests
	burp proxy
	burp suite
Fixing File Upload Vulnerabilities
	1.Never allow users to upload executables(php,exe...etc)
	2.Check the file type AND the fileextension
	3.Analyse the uploaded file itself,recreate it and rename it.
Code Execution Vulnerabilites
	Exploitation Code Execution Vulns
		1.Allows an attacker to execute OS commands
		2.Windows or lunux commands
		3.can be used to get a reverse shell
		4.or upload any file using wget command
		5.code execution commands attached in the resources
		6.ping 10.20.14.203;pwd
		7.nc --v -l -p 8080 //nc:netcate
		8.ls | pwd
		9.ping 10.20.14.208 | pwd
FIxing Code Execution Vulnerabilities
	1.Don't use dangerous functions
	2.Filter use input before execution
Local FIle Inclusion Vulnerabilities(LFI)
	1.Allows an attacker read ANY file on the same server
	2.Access files outside www directory
Remote FIle Inclusion Vulnerabilities(RFI)
	Exploitation-Remote FIle Inclusion
		1.Similar to local file inclusion
		2.But allows an attacker read any file from any server
		3.Execute php files from other servers on the current server
		3.Store php files on other servers as .txt
	Fixing File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
		1.Prevent remove file inclusion
			>Disable allow-url_fopen & all_url_include
		2.Prevent local file inclusion
			>Use static file inclusion
SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
	What SQL?
		1.Most websites use a database to store data.
		2.Most data stored in it(usernames,passwords..etc)
		3.Web application reads,updates and inserts data in the database
		4.Interaction with DB done using SQL
	Dangers of SQL Injections
		1.
Discovering SQL Injections In POST
	1.Try to break the page
	2.Using 'and','order by' or "".
	3.Test text boxes and url parameters on the form
	  http://target.com/page.php?something=something
	4.Select * from accounts where username='azid' and password='123456 and 1=1'#

	Filters can be bypassed
	Use black list of commands?Still can be bypassed
	Use whitelist?Same issue
	Use parameterized statements,separate data from sql code
XSS Vulnerabilities
	XSS- Cross Site Scripting vulns
		1.Allow an attacker to inject javascript code into the page

		2.Reflected XSS
		3.DOM based XSS
	Discovering XSS(Cross site scripting)
		1.Try to inject javascript code into the pages
		2.Test text boxes and url parameters on the form
	Discovering Advanced Reflected XSS
		<Script>alert('xss')</script>
	Discovering An even More Advanced Reflected XSS
	Discovering Stored XSS
		1.Persistent,stored on the page or DB
		2.THe injected code is executed everytime the page is loaded
	Discovering Advanced Stored XSS

[Security] Fixing XSS Vulnerabilities
	1.Minimize the usage of user input on html
	2.Escape any untrusteed input before inserting it into the page
Insecure Session Management
	Logging In As Admin Without a Password By Mainpulating Cookies
		cookiemanager firefox addon
	Discovering Cross Site Request Forgery Vulnerabilities(CSRF)
		1.Requests are not validated at the server side
		2.Server does not check if the user generated the request
		3.Requests can forged and sent to users to make them do things they 
		  don't intent to do such as changing their password
