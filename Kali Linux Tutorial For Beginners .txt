Adding/removing software and updating/upgrading your system
	Packages
		-In Linux,packages=software
		-you may wish to install or remove packages
		-These packages often require dependencies
		-Different Linux distributions have different package
		 management software
		-For example,Red Hat has yum,Debian has apt
	Advanced Packaging tool
		-apt-cache search -search for package
		-apt-cache show - show information about package
		-apt-get install -install package
		-apt-get install -y - Auto answer yes
		-apt-get remove -Remove package (but leave configs)
		-apt-get purge -Remove package and configs
		apt-cache search graphical ftp
		apt-cache show filezilla
		apt-get -y install filezilla
		apt-get remove filezilla
Understanding Where software on Kali Linux comes from
	cat /etc/apt/sources.list
	apt-get update Resynchronize sources
	apt-get upgrade Upgrade all installed packages to newset version
	Find versions of installed applications
		dpkg -l
	install package
		dpkg -i package.deb
	Remove package
		dpkg -r package.deb
	Mission
		1.install FileZilla.Activate FTP on you windows machine and from kali
		  connect to your FTP server using Filezilla
		2.Install Nessus on Kali

		tar c -create archive
		tar r- Append to archive
		tart t -List contents of archive
		tar x -Extract archive 
		tar v -Verbose
		tar f file -File to use
	Cmpression
		gzip - CLassic compression in Linxu

Using wildcards to speed up tasks
	WildCards
		-AKA globbing,are characters or strings used for pattern matching
		-Used with command line to increase flexibility of search
		* - Matches zero or all characters
		? - Matches exactly one character
		[] -Matches any of the characters enclosed in the brackets
		\ -Escape character
		mkdir notes
		mv notes* notes
		ls notes-*
How to get help when needed
	cd /usr/share/wordlists/

	apropos gzip
	which gzip
	man -k gzip
	gzip --help

	How to edit files with nano
		1.nano is a clone of pico
		2.Both are available on Kali
		3.If you are using another Linux and nano isn't avialble look
		  for pico
		4.nano isn't as advanced as vi,vim or emacs
		5.vi,vim and emacs will not be covered in this course
	  	6.nano hackersacademy.txt
		  cat hackeracademy.tx
	Turning your Kali Linux into a webserver
		Secure SHell
			1.Normally used for remote login and remote
			  administration
		Apache
			1.Web Server
			2.you should know what that is by now
		SSH and Apache are both useful to upload/download to/from target
		service apache2 start
		cd /var/www/html/
		ls
		echo "Hello Ethical Hackers!"
Configuration file changes in Kali Linux 2018
	service ssh start
	ssh localhost
	nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	service ssh restart
Turning your Kali Linux into an SSH Server
	cd /etc/ssh
	ls
	mkdir default-keys
	mv ssh_host_* default-keys/
	ls
	dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
	ls
	nano sshd_config
	search word:ctrl+w
	service ssh restart
Managing users and groups
	IDS
		1.Every user has an ID
		2.User root has ID 0
		3.New users start from ID 1000,1001 etc
		4.Every user will belong to a group
		5.By default group with the same name as user will created
	Whoami - Displays your username
	w -shows whos's logged on and what they are doing
	cat /etc/passwd - see a list of users
	cat /etc/shadow -see encrypted passwords
	Add/Delete users
		adduser tom
		useradd tom
		userdel tom
		deluser 
	switch user
		su tom
	Add/Delete groups
		addgroup cats - Create a new group cats
		usermod -g cats tom - Change tom's group
		delgroup tom - Delete group tom
	Maintaing permissios f users
		File/dir permissions
			r-read w-write x-Execute
			u-User(owner) g-Group assigned file or dir
			o-other 
			a- All
			+ Add Permission
			- Remove permission
			= Make this the only permission
		CHMOD Examples
			chmod ugoa +-= rwx filename -syntax
			chmod u+x somefile - Make somefile executable for owner
			chmod a+rw somefile -Make somefile readable and writeable by everyone
					 (word readble and writable)
		ls -l
Understanding processes
	1.A process is a running instance of a command
	They can be managed,that is
		Viewed
		Paused
		Stopped
		Put in background
		Brought back to foreground
	Attributes
		1.Every process has a unique ID
		2.Every process is associated with user and group
		3.Process running by root for example would have more access rights that a process
		  running by a regular user
	List
		ps-List processes of current session
		ps -f -List processes with full formating
		ps -e -List all processes
		ps -u [username] -List processes of [username]
		ps -p [pid] -Display informatio PID
		kill [PID]
		kill -9 [PID] -Forces stop process
Managing process
	Back/foreground
		command & - Run command in background
		jobs -List jobs running in background
		fg [n] - Foreground job number[n]
	nmap -v  -TO hackthisite.org &
	jobs
	fg 1
	tmux - Another way to do the same as above
	ps -u tom
	su tom 
	tmux list-sessions
Command redirection and controlling output
Chaining multiple commands together
	ls /usr/share/namp/scripts | less
	ls /usr/share/namp/scripts | grep brute
	wc -l targets.txt
	less targets.txt
	grep 10.10.10 targets.txt> 10s.txt
	grep 25/open
	grep 25/open output.gnmap | cut -d " " -f 2
	Use grep to find and sort unique IP addresses with port 80 open
	Use grep to find and sort unique IP addresses with port 22 open
Hacking with Kali Linux
	ifconfig
	netdiscover -r 192.168.190.144/24
	Port scanning with kali linux
		nmap -v -p 0-65535 -A 192.168.190.145 -oA metasplotiable2
		nmap -v -T -p 0-65535 -A 192.168.190.145 -oA metasplotiable2
		mkdir target
		mv metasplotiable2*
	Port scanning using with kali linux
	Hacking with Kali LInux -FTP hacking
		apt-get install ftp
	Vulnerablility scanning with Kali linux
		netstat -antp
